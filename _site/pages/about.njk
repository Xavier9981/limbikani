      As a Zambian it hurts me to see the minimal original content that is on
      the internet representing us Zambians, the funny part is that even the
      minimal content present on the internet right now isn't even published by
      Zambians most of the time. Henceforth the content delieved isn't fact
      checked thoroughly and the stories told aren't told from a common
      Zambian's perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why I'am doing my part with the setting up of Mabonzo a proudly
      Zambian owned website which is purposefully built to be an online
      encyclopedia of Zambian names only. My hope and prayer is that this
      initiative will help movitate more Zambians to do the same and maybe we
      can increase the content present on the net representing Zambians.
